Exam for android development program.
    
    ## Completed so far:
    A lot of backend stuff

    ## TODO
    Make database functional. There are typeconverters necessary since i need a 
    location table as well as the main one with the created characters.

    Make sure location fetching API actually works as intended.

    UI for Screen 1,2,3.

    Making screen 4. Screen 4 will be an overview of episodes where you can click in on an
    episode to view more information about it. It will fetch data from the API. Perhaps you can toggle whether
    you have seen it and save it to a local database?
